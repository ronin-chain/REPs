## Abstract

This proposal specifies the activation of Pectra features on Ronin. 

## Rationale

The process of incorporating changes allows Ronin to introduce new features in Ethereum. With this REP, our intention is to enhance our network by integrating a selection of EIPs.

## Specification

This REP includes the following EIPs:

- [EIP-2537: Precompile for BLS12-381 curve operations](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2537)
- [EIP-2935: Serve historical block hashes from state](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935)
- [EIP-7702: Set Code for EOAs](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702) 
- [EIP-7623: Increase calldata cost](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7623) 

## Security analysis

The new feature does not affect the security of Ronin.
