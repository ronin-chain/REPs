## Abstract

This proposal specifies the activation of Berlin features on Ronin. 

## Rationale

The process of incorporating changes allows Ronin to introduce new features in Ethereum. With this REP, our intention is to enhance our network by integrating a selection of EIPs.

## Specification

This REP includes the following EIPs:

- [EIP-2565: ModExp Gas Cost](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2565)
- [EIP-2929: Gas cost increases for state access opcodes](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2929)
- [EIP-2930: Optional access lists](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2930) 

[EIP-2718: Typed Transaction Envelope](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718) was proposed in [REP-0007](../REP-0007/REP-0007.md).

## Security analysis

The new feature does not affect the security of Ronin.
